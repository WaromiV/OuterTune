A Material 3 YouTube Music client & local music player for Android

> [!NOTE]

## Differences from Upstream

Changes applied on top of [OuterTune/OuterTune](https://github.com/OuterTune/OuterTune):

- Fixed several YouTube Music bugs (empty album tracks, playlist crash, search result parsing); improved YTM thumbnail resolution
- Improved lyrics fetching accuracy and latency (LrcLib + caption tracks); added lyrics toggle button to now-playing action bar
- Fixed bottom navigation: tapping a tab goes directly to the tab root; re-tapping the active tab scrolls to top and resets the search bar; search bar state is preserved per route
- Added "keep audio focus" player setting
- Restored tablet UI; fixed player double overlay; made dialogs scrollable
- Local tag extraction via TagLib (all flavors); ffMetadataEx kept for the FFmpeg audio decoder (full flavor); improved local music linking and gapless playback
- Fixed the album song count shown on the album screen
- Replaced the manual high contrast toggle with automatic detection of the system contrast setting (Android 14+)
- Added a custom accent color option with a palette of 13 presets, mutually exclusive with dynamic (Material You) theming
- Updated Kotlin, KSP, NewPipeExtractor, Ktor, AGP, and Gradle

## Features

OuterTune is a supercharged fork of [InnerTune](https://github.com/z-huang/InnerTune). This app is both a local media player, and a YouTube Music client.

- YouTube Music client features
  * Song downloading (offline playback)
  * Seamless playback: no ADs & background playback
  * Account synchronization
    + Full playlist sync from the app to the remote account is temporally unavailable
- Local audio file playback (ex. MP3, OGG, FLAC, etc.)
  * Play local and Youtube Music songs at the same time
  * Uses a custom tag extractor instead of MediaStore's broken metadata extractor! (e.g tags delimited with \ now show up properly)
- Sleek Material3 design
- Multiple queues
- Synchronized lyrics, and support for word by word/Karaoke lyrics formats (e.g LRC, TTML)
- Audio normalization, tempo/pitch adjustment, and various other audio effects
- Android Auto support
- Support for Android 8 (Oreo) and higher

> [!NOTE]
> Android 8 (Oreo) and higher is supported. While the app may work on Android 7.x (Nougat), we do not officially support this version
